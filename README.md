Base example project with Spring Boot. Read the comments to understand the code. Very easy to start a new application.

Run Application.java and It will run a new Tomcat on your localhost in the 8180 port.

Created with Intellij IDEA 15.0.3

If you use other IDE just ignore the SpringBootWithTomcatBaseProject.iml file and the .idea directory
